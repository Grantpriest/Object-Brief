<p>WC_GD_2021</p>

<p>Brief</p>

<p>Aims: </p>

<ul>
<li>Discover and develop your own interests and begin incorporating them into your work.</li>
<li>To build the foundations of a design 'practice'.</li>
<li>Most design corporations demand homogeneity and adherence to a singular idea of 'what design is'. An aim of this project is to help you discover your own approach, one which incorporates your individual, unique perspectives and interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Foundational Idea (Up for debate!):
Design, unlike art or music, needs to solve practical problems. This doesn't mean you must put yourself aside, or your work cant incorporate visual poetry. It just means you must take into account your audience. A designer has a responsibility to their audience first. To me, this is graphic designs greatest asset, it's inherently a practice which is based upon and requires the involvement of others. A graphic designer's job is to contribute to the everyday, lived environment of their audience. This is similar to way that a furniture designer must consider how their audience lives with their chair, how it looks, how it feels, how it integrates into their daily lives, what memories and associations it conjures. </p>

<p>Outcomes:</p>

<p>Website:
 Create a website which documents your findings and visual explorations of your chosen object.
 <br/>
 The website itself should be considered a 'lab', a place for exploring ways of representing the object, it's history, its contemporary context, how it's portrayed in popular media and most importantly; how you relate to it, what it means to you and how you connect to it.
 <br/>
 It should also be a space to explore how the medium lends itself to making connections or 'linking' things together. What techniques can you find for showing connections between things. <em>(Show here examples of websites with overlays, animations, interesting or unexpected navigations).</em></p>
